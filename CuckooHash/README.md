## Data Structures Project 3: Hashing 

Assigned hashing technique: Cuckoo Hashing

### Details

**Deliverables:**

      1) A research paper
      2) Supporting code that works (runs) and supports your research (using your programming skill in
          C++).

**Sourcecode:**
You must create your own source code that is used as the focus or basis of test cases and subsequent
hypothesis in your research paper. 

**Rubric:**

*Research*                                               

The format of the work follows the specified guidelines. The hypothesis is well formed.
The information regarding the data structure of this research is solid and articulate. The
project implemented well considered test cases; thorough and solid testing. The results
and measures from the experiments are well outlined and well documented. The analysis              
is thorough and accurate, and uses good techniques and proofs for considering both the            
data structure’s space complexity and the runtime complexity of each structure overall.
The resulting final analysis compares and concludes, with proof, what is optimally
efficient (worse case), and supports the hypothesis.

*Coding and Accuracy*                                     
        
Program is properly documented, such as header and comments, purpose, and
instructions on how to use your program. Implementations follow from design patterns.
The program is well designed, logically sound (no segment faults), produces correct
results (eg., correctness after insertion, removal, etc…). Program solution code does not
use the STL for its data structure. IMPORTANT: Program properly handles memory 
(no memory leaks). The behavior of the code maintains the properties of the data structure
accurately and predictably. For example, the properties of a BST or max-heap and so on,
are not violated, no duplicates allowed where applicable, performs all of the basic
operations of an AVL tree or linked list or handles all stack operations or probing
functions, etc…
      
**Notes:**
   
    1) Your program should compile and run;
    2) Your program may not use anything from the Standard Template Library for your data structure;
    3) Your program should run tests against ONE other experimenters;
    4) Make sure your program can pass the test cases before submitting the code.
