# Project 2: LZW Compression Algorithm
3460:435/535 Algorithms

The purpose of this programming project is to learn and implement a variant of the compression algorithm LZW. Your tasks for this
assignment are to (1) run LZW as it is and (2) modify LZW to incorporate the advantages of variable length coding

### Build 
1. CMAKE file provided 
2. mkdir build 
3. cmake .. 
4. make 

### Run
- Part 1
   - Compression   => ./lzw435 c [.txt file name]
   - Decompression => ./lzw435 e [.lzw file name]

- Part 2
   - Compression   => ./lzw435M c [.txt file name]
   - Decompression => ./lzw435M e [.lzw2 file name]

### Assumptions
- CMAKE version >= 3.10
- test cases are located in the same directory as executables
