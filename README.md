I'm now at the University of Akron studying Computer Science

My two earliest loves were Guitar and Basketball, which have held through time. Now, I'm very initrigued by writing, film, and videogames. The latter two were the interests that originally brought me to Computer Science. I wanted to know a little more, not only about the artistic side, but how they are accomplished technically. I'd like to make that a long-term goal of mine.

I learned here that I care alot about this stuff; It's interesting to me all the way down, below the elegance of the screen. 
I'm committed to taking on any and all challenges coming my way as I continue down this career path.
