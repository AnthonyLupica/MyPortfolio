### std::cout << "Hello Anthony Lupica\n";

#### A bit about me...
I grew up in Concord Twp, Ohio. <br>
I graduated from the University of Akron with a BS in Computer Science. <br>

My two earliest loves were playing the Guitar and Basketball, which have remained a part of my life. I also enjoy writing, film, and videogames; 
the latter two of which were the interests that originally brought me to Computer Science. I wanted to know more, not only artistically, 
but about how these projects are accomplished technically. I'd like to make that a persistent long-term goal as I gain experience in this field.

I learned at UA that I care alot about learning.
I'm committed to taking on any and all challenges coming my way as I continue down this path.

The purpose of this repository is to be an archive for my past school projects.

It it you'll find... 
- my resume
- several projects and their documentations
