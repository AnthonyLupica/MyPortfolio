#### A bit about me...
I grew up in Concord Twp, Ohio. <br>
I am now at the **University of Akron** studying **Computer Science**. <br>

My two earliest loves were Guitar and Basketball, which have remained a big part of my life. Now, I'm also very initrigued by writing, film, and videogames. 
The latter two were the interests that originally brought me to Computer Science. I wanted to know more, not only about the artistic side, 
but about how they are accomplished technically. I'd like to make that a persistent long-term goal as I gain experience in this field.

But, I learned here that I care alot about this stuff. It's interesting to me all the way down, below the elegance of the screen. 
I'm committed to taking on any and all challenges coming my way as I continue down this career path.
