# NQueens
Artificial Intelligence: Project 1

Problem Description: The N-queens is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Wiki has detailed description of the problem and the history of the problem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

The objective of this project is to implement **backtracking algorithm** to solve the N-queens problem. To make your project more interesting, a constraint (the 1st Queen's position) will be specified. You are to solve the problem and obtain a feasible solution that is conforming to the constraint. No need to find all feasible solutions. Report "No solution" if there is no compatible solution.

Specific requirements:

1. Your program takes in an input file (.csv file) that specifies the chessboard with the 1st Queen's position. 

2. Your program solves N-queens with specified position for the 1st Queen.

3. Your program will save the solution to a .csv file; it should have the same format as the input file.
